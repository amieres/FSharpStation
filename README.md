# Snippets, snippets, snippets.
F# Station represents a different paradigm of code organization.

Programming by snippets. 

Instead of files, organize your code in snippets, have them all in one place, 
select the ones you need, reuse the code in several projects and develop your own code base with your personal style.

# How to Install

- Download Zip File: https://github.com/amieres/FSharpStation/archive/master.zip
- UnZip somewhere
- Run installation: INSTALL FSharpStation.cmd
- Install .net Framework 4.6.1 SDK:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49978

# To Run:

- Close Chrome to ensure a new instance is opened
- DoubleClick on: Open FSharpStation.cmd
- Open latest .fsjson file

- Go to the snippet: FSSGlobal/WebSharper Code/WebSharper Snippets1/Demo Grid
- Click on: Run WebSharper in...

- A new tab should open or it may be blocked by the popup blocker. Disable for localhost:9010

# To Save your work:

Saving a file is actually downloading it. For convenience is better to indicate where to save it everytime:
- Goto chrome://settings/
- Click on Advanced
- Select option "Ask where to save each file before downloading" 

# WIP
This is a work in progress. But it is already fully usable and fun to use. 

Try it.

Get code from the web, add your own, try new things and integrate them into your projects.

With new actions added every time FSharpStation can become a personal console of operations.
